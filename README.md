# Wall-go - Game Rules

**Objective**
Move your pieces on a 7×7 board and build walls to carve out your own ‘territory’ (an enclosed area containing only your pieces). When the game ends, count the squares in each player’s territory; the player with the most wins.

**Equipment & Players**
*   **Board:** 7×7 squares
*   **Players:** 2-player: Red and Blue, each with 4 pieces
*   **Walls:** Unlimited, color-coded by player

**Game Flow**

**Placement Phase**
*   **Starting positions fixed:** Red [1,1],[5,5]; Blue [1,5],[5,1]. 
*   The other two are placed alternately: Red, Blue, Blue, Red

**Action Phase (turn-based)**
1.  **Choose** any of your pieces that can still act.
2.  **Move** 0, 1, or 2 steps:
    *   Each step must be up, down, left, or right.
    *   Cannot cross or pass through walls or other pieces.
3.  **Place a wall** on an open side of that piece’s square (even if you moved 0 steps).

**Walls & Borders**
*   The board’s outer edge counts as a wall.
*   Walls cannot be removed once placed.

**Time Limit**
*   90 seconds per turn.
*   If time runs out, a wall is placed randomly and the turn ends.

**End Condition**
*   The game ends when all players’ pieces are in separate territories.

**Scoring**
*   Each square in a territory is worth 1 point.
*   If total scores are tied, the player with the largest single territory wins.

**Victory**
*   Highest score wins.
*   If both total and largest territory are tied, it’s a draw.
